# TYPE
# NESTED SETS



# IT CAN NOT BE INDEXED (ERROR)
# THE ORDER OF THE ITEMS IS UNKNOWN


# ALL ITEMS ARE UNIQUE
# TRUE = 1 AND FALSE = 0


# THE EDIT IS LIMITED (ANYTHING THAT IS NOT INVOLVED INDEXES):
# ADDING ITEMS
# my_set.add(value)
# my_set.update(collection: list/tuple/set)
# set3 = set1.union(set2)



# REMOVING ITEMS
# my_set.remove(value) - make sure the value exists
# in / not in
# my_set.discard(value) - wont be an error if the value does not exist.
# my_set.pop(empty only)
# del my_set - no [index]


# FOR LOOPS WITHOUT ENUMERATE


# THERE ARE MANY OPTIONS FOR COMPARING SETS

# EX 1 - Write a Python program to add 2 to this set - my_set = {1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}

# EX 2 Write a Python program to remove the number 3 from the set from the last exercise.

# EX 3 - Write a Python program to remove an item from a set if it is present in the set.

# EX 4 - Write a Python program to remove all elements from a given set.

# EX 5 - Write a Python program to remove duplicates from a list.

# EX 6 - Write a Python program to check if two given sets have no elements in common.
